# RandomBalanceBoost
Implementation of Random Balance Boost algorithm

Description
----------
Random Balance is ensemble of classifiers for two-class imbalanced data sets. Each member of the Random Balance ensemble is trained with data sampled from the training set and augmented by artificial instances obtained using SMOTE.
This repo is a simple implementation of Random Balance Boost algorithm . RB-Boost(Random Balance Boost) is combination of Random Balance and AdaBoost.M2.
